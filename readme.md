Paladini Photography Blogger Theme
=================

![](http://i.imgur.com/G2NOOOc.png)

A simple blogger theme for photographers based on [Kamera Photography Free](http://www.veethemes.com/2015/01/kamera-photography-blog.html).

The only difference between this theme and the original is that I've made some small changes:

- Social network buttons removed;
- Share posts removed;
- Added blog description right after the blog title.
- Facebook Like Box added. 

You can check the current version of this theme in this [live website](http://silviopaladini.blogspot.com.br/).
